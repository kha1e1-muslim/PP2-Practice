# Classes and objects are the two core concepts in object-oriented programming.
# A class defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class. For example:

# class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content
# put in the "pass" statement to avoid getting an error.
class Person:
  pass
