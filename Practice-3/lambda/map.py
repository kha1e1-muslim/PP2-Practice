# lambda is very useful when it used use build in funcitons like map:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))
print(doubled)
# here is the example of doubling the values in the list numbers, using map with lambda
# so lambdaa+map is used to apply some ANOLOGICAL CHanges to a list
